We’re on a mission to make building websites fun

## Mission and Vision

To help create and inspire improvements to the web, a critical resource for all of humanity. We do this by shortening the time to experiment, to collaborate around changes, and to deploy incremental improvements.

Gatsby provides development teams an open source frontend framework for creating dynamic, optimized websites and a cloud platform for delivering them on a blazing fast edge network.

More than just a static site generator, Gatsby has all the tools for building the modern web: Plugins for seamlessly integrating data from a CMS (Content Management System), a performant React-based runtime for the framework, and a Cloud platform for delivering the fastest sites on the web. Performance. SEO. Security. Integrations. Accessibility. We’ve got it covered for you. Gatsby makes the hardest parts of building an amazing digital experience simple.
