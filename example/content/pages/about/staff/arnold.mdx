Dr. Ford reveals to Bernard that he had a creative partner during the development of the park, and that his partner's name was Arnold. According to Ford, Arnold had grander ambitions for the hosts than being pseudo-humans in a theme park. "He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit," Ford said. "He wanted the real thing. He wanted to create consciousness." Ford illustrates how Arnold intended to do this by drawing a pyramid with "memory on the bottom, then improvisation, and then self-interest." Ford leaves the top of the pyramid empty, and claims that Arnold never decided what to put there.

When Bernard asks about what happened to Arnold, Ford says that Arnold withdrew, speaking only with the hosts and was consumed by his desire to create consciousness, until his death in the park. Arnold's death was declared an accident, but Ford believes otherwise.
