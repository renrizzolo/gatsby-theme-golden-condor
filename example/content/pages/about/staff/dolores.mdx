Dolores Abernathy was the first host created in the Argos Initiative and therefore is the oldest host in service in Westworld and was built by Arnold Weber. She predates all other first-generation hosts such as Clementine, Angela and Craddock. She has been updated numerous times over the years as Ashley Stubbs told Elsie Hughes, so she may or may not have had a biological body by the time of the events in second season. It seems very likely that she would have had a new biological body printed for her outside the park, which would be by the beginning of third season.
