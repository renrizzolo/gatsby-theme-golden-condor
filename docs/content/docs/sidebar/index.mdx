import Sidebar from "@components/Sidebar";

## Sidebar overview

The sidebar is a component which lists other pages in the same collection, so users can easily navigate through the related content. This is a standard pattern for documentation websites, but could be used to group any kind of content together.

All content in the collection is listed, ordered by `frontmatter.date`.

## Enabling the sidebar

The sidebar can be opted in to on a per-collection basis.

To do so, the `sidebarNav` object needs to be present on the collection's config:

`gatsby-config.js`

```js {5-8}
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-theme-golden-condor`,
    options: {
      collections: {
        pages: {
          sidebarNav: {
            heading: "Pages",
            width: 220
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

The above will enable a 300px wide sidebar with the heading Pages, on all entries under content/pages.

## Add parent/child relationships via frontmatter

The sidebar supports a sub-level with togglable display of child entries. It also supports a sub-sub-level, which is further indented but doesn't have an expand/collapse toggle.

1. In the parent `md(x)` file, add an `id` field:

```md {3}
---
title: Parent Page
id: parent-page
---
```

2. In the child `md(x)` files, add a `parent` field, with the parent's `id` value:

```md {3}
---
title: Child Page
parent: parent-page
---
```

```md {3}
---
title: Another Child Page
parent: parent-page
---
```

This would result in a sidebar with the following layout:

<Sidebar
  options={{ heading: "Pages", width: 220 }}
  entries={[
    {
      childMdx: {
        childEntries: [
          {
            slug: "child-page/",
            path: "/page/child-page/",
            collection: "page",
            frontmatter: {
              id: null,
              title: "Child Page",
              parent: "parent-page",
            },
            parent: {
              sourceInstanceName: "page",
            },
          },
          {
            slug: "another-child-page/",
            path: "/page/another-child-page/",
            collection: "page",
            frontmatter: {
              id: null,
              title: "Another Child Page",
              parent: "parent-page",
            },
            parent: {
              sourceInstanceName: "page",
            },
          },
        ],
        slug: "parent-page/",
        path: "/page/parent-page/",
        collection: "page",
        frontmatter: {
          id: null,
          title: "Parent Page",
          parent: null,
        },
        parent: {
          sourceInstanceName: "page",
        },
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

## Create a heading without a page

To create a 'linkless' parent page, in the parent page's `md(x)` file, add a null path field.

```md {4}
---
title: Parent Page
id: parent-page
path: null
---
```

The result of this is that this page isn't created by Gatsby at all. It will show in the sidebar with its title but it won't link to anything:

<Sidebar
  options={{ heading: "Pages", width: 220 }}
  entries={[
    {
      childMdx: {
        childEntries: [
          {
            slug: "child-page/",
            path: "/page/child-page/",
            collection: "page",
            frontmatter: {
              id: null,
              title: "Child Page",
              parent: "parent-page",
            },
            parent: {
              sourceInstanceName: "page",
            },
          },
          {
            slug: "another-child-page/",
            path: "/page/another-child-page/",
            collection: "page",
            frontmatter: {
              id: null,
              title: "Another Child Page",
              parent: "parent-page",
            },
            parent: {
              sourceInstanceName: "page",
            },
          },
        ],
        slug: "parent-page/",
        collection: "page",
        frontmatter: {
          id: null,
          title: "Parent Page",
          parent: null,
        },
        parent: {
          sourceInstanceName: "page",
        },
      },
    },
  ]}
/>
