## Site Metadata

Site Metadata is used by the theme for SEO and other purposes. Please be aware that if you don't add these to your gatsby-config, they will be empty strings in most cases.

**`gatsby-config.js`**

```js {3-17}
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    siteUrl: "https://www.yourdomain.tld",
    title: "Your Title",
    titleTemplate: "%s | Your Title",
    author: "Your Name",
    description: "site description",
    image: "static-image.png",
    social: [
      {
        name: "@gatsbyjs",
        url: "https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs",
      },
      {
        name: "Github",
        url: "https://github.com/gatsbyjs",
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-theme-golden-condor`,
      options: {},
    },
  ],
};
```

### `siteUrl`

`siteUrl` is used to generate the urls in the `SEO` component, for open graph / twitter meta tags and image urls.

This should be your full URL including the protocol, without a trailing slash.

### `title`

`title` is used in the header and footer logo components, as a fallback for when no logo images are provided. It is also used as the alt text for said logo images.

`title` is also used in the SEO component for the document /meta titles, for pages without a frontmatter title.

### `titleTemplate`

The title template to pass to <Link href="https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet">`react-helmet`</Link>

### `author`

`author` is used in the footer, after **Â© currentYear**.

### `description`

`description` is used for meta tags where `frontmatter.excerpt` isn't present.

### `image`

An image filename, placed in the `static` folder in the root of your project.

`image` is used as the default SEO image where `frontmatter.image` isn't present.

### `social`

`social` is an array of objects with `label` and `url` keys. These links are displayed in the footer. They can be any links you like, not limited to social media.

```js
social: [
  {
    label: "facebook",
    url: "https://fb.me/...",
  },
  {
    label: "twitter",
    url: "https://twitter.com/...",
  },
];
```

### `twitterHandle`

This will be used for the `twitter:site` meta tag, e.g `@yourname`.
