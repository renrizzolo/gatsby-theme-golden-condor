## Navigation

The header and footer nav menus are defined in a yaml file, `content/pages/navigation.yml`.

It looks like this:

```yaml
- label: Docs
  path: /docs
  locations: [top]

- label: About
  path: /about
  locations: [top, footer]
```

### `label`

The text to display on the menu item

### `path`

The path the menu item links to

### `locations`

Where the menu item should be shown. Options are `top` and `footer`. As this is an array, you can choose either or both.

<hr />

## Social links

The footer also has a social links section. These are defined by an array of label/url objects under `social` in `gatsby-config.js` <Link to="/doc/site-metadata#social">siteMetadata</Link>
