## Gatsby Theme Golden Condor

Gatsby Theme Golden Condor is a blog/docs/anything theme for [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)

It has all this stuff:

- **MDX**
- **Theming** & **dark mode** via **[theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com)**
- Awesome syntax highlighting via **[mdx-pretty-code](https://github.com/atomiks/mdx-pretty-code)**
- Unlimited **collections** (custom post types)
- Categories & tags
- Configurable **layouts**
- Configurable **recent/related posts** grids
- Built in **SEO**
- **TOC** with active **section highlighting**
- Configurable **Sidebar navigation**
- Component **shadowing**

## Motivation

I really just wanted to a) make a gatsby theme and b) try to do so only using the [File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/)

I kind of built out the basic blog theme in 2020 and left it for dead. Later on in 2021 I had the need to produce a docs site for another project, so I began refining the theme and adding various extras like syntax highlighting, multiple content types and layout configurations.

Was using the File System Route API worth it? There's a whole lot of customization in `gatsby-node.js` regardless, and I still haven't figured out a way to do pagination with it. I'd say it's not quite there in terms of a catch-all solution.
