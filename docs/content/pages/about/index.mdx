## Gatsby Theme Golden Condor

Gatsby Theme Golden Condor is a markdown/MDX blog/docs/anything theme for [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)

It has all this stuff:

<Box>

<Box
  sx={{
    "&:hover": {
    },
    span: {
      transition: "color 400ms ease",
    },
    "&:hover span": {
      transform: "translateX(5px)",
      color: "primary.2",
    },
    "&:hover span:nth-child(1)": {
      fontWeight: 600,
      color: "primary.2",
    },
    "&:hover span:nth-child(2)": {
      fontWeight: 600,
      transitionDelay: "100ms",
      color: "primary.3",
    },
    "&:hover span:nth-child(3)": {
      fontWeight: 600,
      transitionDelay: "200ms",
      color: "primary.4",
    },
  }}

## Who is this for?

This theme has been developed to make customizations relatively easy - quite a lot can be achieved just by editing the shadowed theme file `src/gatsby-theme-golden-condor/theme/index.js` and making some adjustments to the [theme options](/doc/theme-options) for collections.

Having said that, a good amount of Gatsby/React experience will unlock most of the power due to [Theme componenet shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing).

I Think if you're building a site with MDX you probably know what you're doing ;)

## Motivation

I really just wanted to a) make a gatsby theme and b) try to do so only using the [File System Route API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/file-system-route-api/)

I kind of built out the basic blog theme in 2020 and left it for dead. Later on in 2021 I had the need to produce a docs site for another project, so I began refining the theme and adding various extras like syntax highlighting, multiple content types and layout configurations.

Was using the File System Route API worth it? There's a whole lot of customization in `gatsby-node.js` regardless, and I still haven't figured out a way to do pagination with it. I'd say it's not quite there in terms of a catch-all solution.

## Golden Condor? This theme is suspiciously purple!
